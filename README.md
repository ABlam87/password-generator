# Password Generator

## Description

This is a password generator! The html and css, and 20% of the javascript code, were pre-provided by the edX Skills for Life Coding Bootcamp. The rest of the javascript programming is my own.

This generator will create a completely random and unique password for you at the click of a button. It is customisable based on:

- your desired length of password
- which characters you wish you include 
- what case you wish to include
